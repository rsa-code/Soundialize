# Soundialize

## Concept

This is a project that I worked on with two friends on University, we were still trying to get the grasp of JavaScript, as well as trying to perfect our HTML and CSS. It was hard sometimes but I think we did a pretty good job. It's a social media with It's focus on music and getting to know other people.
It does not have database of any sorts, so It's pretty much not functional. I really want to get It to work, I think It would be pretty interesting.
